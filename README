= where_is_within3

    Within3 team members love to eat out for lunch or, work from a coffee shop in the afternoon. Additionally,
    our offices are located right in the heart of an amazing coffee, beer, and food district. However, all these
    great locations nearby makes it cumbersome to track everyone down. That being the case, Within3 has
    decided to contract you to build a simple geo-location service for us to find out not just where everyone is
    at, but where they are most likely to be.
